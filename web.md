#Better Energy Production

Better Energy production introduces various buildings and items to the game. Explore new ways of creating sustainable energy and keeping you world as clean as possible. Start right at the beginning of your world with three options of creating pollution free and clean power. Later research more technologies to expand your possibilities of getting clean power through a variety of wind turbines, solar panels and more!

#Information

*Two solar panels and one wind turbine will be unlocked from the beginning of your game*:
- This will help you get a good and clean power supply right from the beginning of the game
- None of the buildings will create pollution
- They are relative cheap and easy to craft

*Eco wind turbines* will absorb pollution in the chunk they are placed in.

#Features


5 brand new types of wind turbines:

- *Rusty wind turbine* (An old wind turbine intended for power supply in the early phase of the game; *Instantly unlocked*)
- *Wind turbine* (Upgraded version of the rusty wind turbine which generates more electricity)
- *Advanced wind turbine* (Advanced version of the wind turbine which generates even more electricity)
- *Eco wind turbine* (Generates not that much electricity but *absorbs pollution*)
- *Big wind turbine* (A very big wind turbine which generates a lot of electricity)


6 brand new types of solar panels:

- *Small twin solar panel* (A very tiny solar panel intended for power supply in the very early phase of the game; *Instantly unlocked*)
- *Flat solar panel* (A small flat solar panel intended for the power supply in the eraly phase of the game; *Instantly unlocked*)
- *Advanced solar panel* (A advanced version of the vanilla solar panel)
- *Big solar panel* (A big solar panel which creates more electricity comepared to the others)
- *CSP panel* (Concentrated solar panel which uses the sunlight and water to create *heated water*)
- *Smart solar panel* (By rotating its panel axis, the smart solar panel achieves a higher amount of generated electricity)


And more like:

- *Air filter* (Used to craft eco wind turbine)
- *Heated water* (Get heated water through the CSP panel to convert it into steam via the *water distillation* process)
